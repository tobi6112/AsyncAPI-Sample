      This channel is used for exchanging events about user registration.

    # It is crucial to understand, that "subscribe" DOES NOT MEAN, that the defined application 
    # subscribes to this event, the application OFFERS a subscription and would therefore PUBLISH
    # weird but ok? Makes sense kinda, even if its unintuitive
